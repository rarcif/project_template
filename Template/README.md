### Create Pull Request

if not Authenticated yet please run:

```bash
gh auth login
```

If the git CLI prompts the following:

`Which should be the base repository (used for e.g. querying issues) for this directory`

Select the following base repository:

`crypto-org-chain/cronos-awesome`

Then:

```bash
gh pr create --base staging --head ${username}:main
```

This will programatically create PR based on your commit. Once we receive the PR we will review the project details and format.

Once review and approved, you should see your projects on [crypto-org-chain/cronos-awesome/tree/staging](crypto-org-chain/cronos-awesome/tree/staging).
